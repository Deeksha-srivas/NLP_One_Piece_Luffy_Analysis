🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to the NLP One Piece Luffy Analysis! This project dives deep into the emotions, sentiments, and character dynamics surrounding Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece. By analyzing Luffy's dialogue through Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling, we uncover the emotional layers and connections that define his journey.

🔍 What are we doing?

1.Sentiment Analysis: Unlock the emotional landscape of Luffy's words—Is he angry? Affectionate? Or maybe a bit sarcastic? Let’s find out!

2.Character Mentions: Who does Luffy talk about the most? Who shapes his destiny? We analyze the frequent mentions of characters like Shanks, Ace, and more.

3.Topic Modeling: What are the key themes in Luffy's world? Let's explore the deeper layers of his character and emotions.
✨ Why This Project?
Luffy's journey is filled with adventures, challenges, and profound emotions. This project aims to capture the essence of his character through the lens of data science and natural language processing (NLP). By analyzing his dialogue, we can better understand what drives him, how he feels about certain events, and the characters that have impacted his life.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python: The powerhouse behind all the magic.

BeautifulSoup & Requests: Scraping data from the One Piece Wiki page to get Luffy's thoughts.

Pandas: Structuring and cleaning data like a pro.

NLTK: Extracting meaningful insights with NLP.

Excel: Saving and organizing the analysis in Excel.
⚙️ How It Works
Scraping the Wiki: We start by scraping Luffy’s dialogue from the One Piece Wiki page. This gives us raw, unfiltered data straight from the source.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: We clean the data by removing unwanted characters, like URLs and footnotes, and prepare it for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Using VADER, we analyze the sentiment of each sentence. Is Luffy expressing anger, affection, or sacrifice? We categorize his feelings.

Character Mentions: We scan for mentions of key characters in Luffy’s dialogue and identify the most frequently discussed figures on his journey.
